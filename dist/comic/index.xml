It&amp;rsquo;s the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve ever done a class and it&amp;rsquo;s kicking my butt. I&amp;rsquo;m coming up on 40 soon, so I have to do some damage control if I want to keep up with my kids, and&amp;hellip; oh damn, I&amp;rsquo;m doing it, aren&amp;rsquo;t I?]]>

I don&amp;rsquo;t really follow pop music, so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t familiar with the Dave Guetta/Sia song, but the scenario worked for me. Check out the video if you want to hear what Wolvie is rocking out to, and watch what&amp;rsquo;s basically a mini X-men video.]]>
