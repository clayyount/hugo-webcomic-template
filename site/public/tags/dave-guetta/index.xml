      <description><![CDATA[ <a href="https://clayyount.com/comic/2019/05/30/adamantium/"><img src="https://clayyount.com//img/ghostcat-comic-2-adamantium.jpg" /></a><br>This joke was pretty much entirely written by my wife. I don&amp;rsquo;t really follow pop music, so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t familiar with the Dave Guetta/Sia song, but the scenario worked for me. Check out the video if you want to hear what Wolvie is rocking out to, and watch what&amp;rsquo;s basically a mini X-men video.]]>
