## ABOUT ME

I'm a web designer/developer and comic artist. I've been making webcomics since 2000 when I started a strip for my university newspaper, and I've been developing websites since I realized I needed a place to put those comics. 


## ABOUT THE WEBSITE TEMPLATE

 I've created this website template to help you get started with your own site using Hugo, Git and Netlify with Netlify CMS. If you want to give it a try, you can download the template from my [git repository](https://google.com).
